Dear Authorities, dear Manufacturers, dear Sellers,

<br><br>

<!--

in greeting cordially, allow me to remember how important it is to work in order to be ready to welcome the legitimate occurrences of time and also to prepare the cultural and political ground so that it is ready to welcome owns products.

<br><br>

-->

please let me consider the need, now perceived by more people, that areas have been added to the local Structural Plans to receive private mobile units for residential use. New neighborhoods with areas of land are urgently needed (that can be purchased or rented) not buildable but camperizable: on which to place our own mobile units for residential use. To cope with the dynamism of modern life and enjoy multiple opportunities, for the reduced space requirements granted by new technologies, for the well-being provided by modern mobile structures, to an underlying lack of love for masonry, many now wish this possibility.

<br><br>

A good and a resource of multiple uses and values, such as is the Camper, can not be reduced to being hardly tolerated on the street or, often at a high price, hosted by third parties. A Camper, a Motorhome, a Caravan (mobile goods par excellence) are well worthy of benefiting from the synergy with a real estate property: an area, a lot, a land on which the owner can stay without having to ask if he is bothering someone or infringing one of the innumerable laws in force.

</i></b></font>

</div>

</td><td width="50%" valign="top">

<div align="justify">

<font size="4"><b><i>

<br><br>

Far from being a contradiction, joining what is mobile to a real estate, providing in the Structural Plans own areas used for parking and the permanence of Campers with their owners inside, opens scenarios so far unimaginable: such as the temporary exchange of such private areas between campers, even of different nationalities, who will be able to move and live in different zones, having private and safe places of support, but always staying in their own home.

<br><br>

I hope then you will want to support this cultural, economic, urban, innovation in your places of expertise and elsewhere, starting to imagine the benefits deriving from the purchase or rental of one of these lots of land for Camper, Motorhome and Caravan, being purchased or rentable both by public or private.

<br><br>

<!--

Only because now people often experiment everywhere, in addition to the normal needs, also emergency ones, wide and new possibilities must be opened. As well as to not be among those complain whenever there is an economic crisis. On the contrary, I hope you all will be among those can rejoice for having prepared in time the soil for harvest.

<br><br>

-->

Thank you for your attention, warm cordialities,
